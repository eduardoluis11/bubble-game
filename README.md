I would like to mention that I worked with YarCrasy's team in the Gran Canaria version of Global Game Jam 2025, and my name appears in the game submitted to that Game Jam. However, my contribution to that project was minimal. 

I did not use any of their ideas that they utilized in that game jam to make the current project from this current repo (the "bubble-game" repo). All of the code from this repo (the "bubble-game" repo) was written by me, and by using only my own ideas. I did not use any of the code nor any of the ideas from YarCrasy's team. 

Additionally, I did not submit this game from this current repo (the "bubble-game" repo) to the Global Game Jam 2025. I did not submit any game to that jam.
